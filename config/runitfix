 The solution is to place this:

sed -ri 's#install -m000 /dev/null /run/runit/stopit#install -m100 /dev/null /run/runit/stopit#' /etc/runit/1

Into /etc/rc.local.

It seems to be a permission issue of the runit's stopit executable/file.

After you place this in rc.local, reboot (manually) and try rebooting again.
